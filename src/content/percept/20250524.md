### Exit Strategy

**I haven’t had a lucid dream in about a month. I might need to check my notes on that, but it feels like that long if not longer. Today I had a session for intro to Focus 23, then did a 20-minute Focus 15 session. On the way out of Focus 15 I spent some time in Focus 10 “programming” what would happen after I counted “1.” Aside from the usual Monroe-inspired messaging about my body functioning perfectly, I made a point to communicate something more specific: I will be sleepy, I will drift into a lucid dream (or two), and I will experience something new and learn.**

#### Lucid Dream(s) 20250524

So that worked. After I exited my last session I drifted into sleep and had a lucid dream. The altered state began around 4 PM *(simulation time)*. I was talking to Kim about the meditation I had just done in my study when we heard a knock at the front door. She mentioned that Maksim was out and about, so it was probably him. Maksim usually doesn’t go out the front door, but whatever. I went and opened it.

I couldn’t see who it was. The screen door was hard to see through for some reason, which should have been a clue. I saw the shape of a small body on the other side. I figured it was Maksim, but something in me said no, this is someone else. As I reached for the door, the simulation ended and I began my usual exit with the spinning sensation and sinking through the floor. I found myself in a void briefly and tried to fly or project with *everything I had*, but it ended.

I was unsuccessful and woke up. I took my mask off. The blinds were closed and the room was pretty dark except for the glow of the salt lamp by the ottoman. I sat up, gathered myself, and walked out of the study. It was around 3:40 PM *(simulation time)*. **Just like that, the simulation sequence began to end again.** I had triggered another lucid dream while exiting the last one. I smiled as I twirled and sank into the dark again.

I heard both high-pitched and low-pitched frequencies as I emerged in the darkness. The study still had the blinds closed, and I still had my mask on. In the right quadrant of my visual field I saw a bright green structure twirling and twisting. I focused on it and it grew slightly. I managed to hold focus for a few moments. It looked like a six-sided geometric object with more shapes protruding from each face (a glitchy cube). These shapes were also moving and twisting. It was a dynamic object that was hard to identify, but it appeared in crystal clear formation. Maybe it was a crystal, or maybe a hologram of a four-dimensional object, which would explain the strangeness.

The more I reflect on it, the more I think it was a hologram of a four-dimensional object. It was confusing and completely real. It reminded me of the UAPs that Skywatcher captured, but shown in stunning detail that made it even harder to understand.

The next day I debated whether to repeat the intro to F23 or move on to the next track, Intro to Focus 25. I decided that right now, it's best to go through the intro tracks and repeat as needed before finishing this series, *Voyager*. Every time I repeat one, I get a deeper understanding of that focus level. The gestalt upgrades, so to speak.

This series ends with helping lost others transition and contacting loved ones for messages. I don’t want to walk into any of that half-prepared, so I’m putting in the work now instead of jumping in with overconfidence like I often do.

Intro to F25 went pretty much how I expected. Nothing major yet, but something to reflect on did come back again: limiting beliefs. I’ll explore that more later. Right after this session, I did an unguided F21 to reinforce some things and keep adjusting to the *"energy band"* of the 20s focus levels.

To induce another lucid dream, I repeated the same exit protocol from F10. I visualized my body and state after the session. It went like this:

> When I count to "one" I will briefly wake. I will feel tired and sleepy, but my body will be functioning perfectly. I will fall asleep and have a lucid dream where I will experience something new and learn.

I counted to one, took off my headphones, rolled over, and fell asleep in about five minutes.

The lucid dream played out the way they have recently. I woke up in my study, it was very dark, and I took my mask off. I felt slightly annoyed, thinking I had failed to enter a lucid dream again. I began my usual motions for the day. The study looked longer than it was wide, which was unusual, and the scene had a grayscale look to it. I’m making a note of that, since grayscale often shows up during my brief out-of-body experiences.

By the time I folded the bed back into the ottoman and got to the door, I realized I was in a lucid dream. I had tricked myself again. That trickster. I turned to face the window with the blinds still closed. Even though I was lucid, I still had a shred of doubt. I told myself, "Alright, I'm going to fly. If I can't, then I just look silly hopping in the air with no one watching. Let's go."

I started to rise quickly. The ceiling rose with me, which was frustrating, and then it bounced me back down. I remembered I should have used the window, but it was too late. The exit sequence had already started. I spun, sank through the floor, and entered the void.

**Lesson learned:** Next time, open the door and keep moving, or immediately go for the window and fly out. Doing a little hop might look strange if you’re awake, but if you’re not, it might launch you into the air. It’s worth the risk.

**A strategy to attempt:** In F15, build a scene with an open window in the ceiling of the study. Visualize launching through it and into the space above. Experiment with different environments beyond the window. It could be something like outer space, the ocean, a forest, or a familiar real-world location like a childhood home.

To sum it all up: if you find yourself wondering whether you’re in waking life or an altered state, just hop with the intent to fly. Worst case, you’ll feel a bit silly and probably laugh. Best case, you take off into the unknown.
