### Five Messages, a Lucid Dream, and a Wormhole  

**All week I've had pretty mundane sessions. Last week was physically exhausting, and this week I returned to my normal morning routine. Unsurprisingly, my sessions this week were quiet, with frequent episodes of falling asleep midway or shortly after starting—I've just been tired. Today, I decided to take a break from unguided sessions, which require intense concentration, and instead enjoyed following directions from Mr. Monroe. I genuinely missed his guided sessions, so I chose "Five Messages" from Wave 4.**

#### Five Messages

<div class="row p-t-1 p-l-1 p-r-1">

<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">

<h5>5</h5>
<p>Nothing. Just emptiness—not even phosphene activity. This message will come later.</p>

</div>

<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 p-y-1 m-b-1" style="background: light-dark(var(--set-color-base-50), var(--set-color-base-950));">

<h5>An Aside</h5>
<p>I distinctly felt my left hand—especially at the wrist—move up to scratch my nose. However, my physical arm never actually moved; instead, it was a warm buzzing sensation—my energy body.</p>

</div>

</div>

<hr class="m-b-1">

<div class="row p-t-1 p-l-1 p-r-1">

<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">

<h5>4</h5>
<p>Another empty one, similar to before. This message will also come later.</p>

</div>

<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 p-y-1 m-b-1" style="background: light-dark(var(--set-color-base-50), var(--set-color-base-950));">

<h5>An Aside</h5>
<p>Again, a similar experience. I hallucinated moving something toward my mouth with my right arm as if to eat. My physical mouth opened, but my arm stayed still—another energy body movement. 🦾</p>

</div>

</div>

<hr class="m-b-1">

<div class="row p-t-1 p-l-1 p-r-1">

<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">

<h5>3</h5>
<p>A brief vision of someone asking my mom to make pelmeni. 🤨</p>

</div>

<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 p-y-1 m-b-1" style="background: light-dark(var(--set-color-base-50), var(--set-color-base-950));">

<h5>An Aside</h5>
<p>I wasn't hungry. I always ensure I'm neither hungry nor thirsty before sessions. I also handle any bodily needs beforehand to avoid interruptions—pretty standard common-sense preparation. 🤷🏻</p>

Immediately after being prompted to ask and release "what is my second most important question?" into all parts of my consciousness, a discussion started in which I was merely an observer. The voice was familiar; I've heard it before discussing consciousness and reality. It was energetic, fast-paced, humorous, sarcastic—but never mean.

> Release it where? All parts? There are parts? Is it in your head? Somewhere else? The universe? Surely that too is consciousness, but what exactly are 'all parts'? Do you know all of them? How many? Where are they? Sounds like places and destinations… but you're here; your consciousness is here. You're not moving or sending anything anywhere. It’s everywhere and everything all at once. Holding onto the question and releasing it are the same thing. Ask the question, stop pretending to do it—just do it."

I usually visualize synthesizing the question into an energy ball and blasting it upward in all directions, like fireworks. However, this message began immediately, seemingly referencing and interrupting this visualization.

Same voice, one concise message:

***"Stop trying to be and just be."***

#### Lucid Dream
Afterward, I set my intention for a lucid dream and rolled onto my side.

It took a little while, but eventually, the dream unfolded without me realizing until I found myself in the garage gym, struggling to unlock my tablet. It wouldn't unlock, and I realized it wasn’t even in the right place—boom, lucid. Seizing the moment, I mentally initiated flight. I hovered and flew around the gym—look, flying is flying; I'll take it wherever I can. 😂

The gym began spinning around me—a sensation typically indicating that I’m spinning, but this time I was still. Normally, this rapidly ends a lucid dream, causing me to sink and black out. However, this time I stayed focused on the spinning surroundings, not myself. I rose steadily upward, maintaining focus until I exited the dream.

Upon exiting, I kept my focus—this is usually when intriguing things occur. My orientation distinctly "shifted" back into my body lying on its side. My vision was filled with a black void centered around a pulsing white portal—a wormhole. I couldn’t discern if I was moving forward through it or seeing it recede, but it didn't matter. This captivating experience lasted a while as mesmerizing waves of thick, expanding white circles pulsed from the center, washing over me.

It was incredible. 🌀
