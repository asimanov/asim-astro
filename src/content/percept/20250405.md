### Exploring Intuition

**Returning to “Wave V – Exploring Intuition” was a good decision. I’m glad I listened to my gut… there are so many puns to be had here. During today’s sessions, another piece of the whole clicked into place and presented itself to me in the most natural and fluid way yet in the entire time I’ve been doing Gateway tapes.**

#### Unguided Session

During my unguided prep session, I focused on letting go of the need to be in control—allowing myself to gain as much as possible from new experiences. This is one of those insidious fears that hides behind logic and intellect. The ego shows up in new situations to guard and protect—which is good. But then it assumes full control and pumps the brakes on anything unfamiliar or upsetting that doesn’t fit into your current worldview—because that’s its job… which is *not* so good.

Getting the most out of a new experience by letting it unfold while being an active observer requires diminishing this automatic ego response—relegating it to “break glass in case of emergency” mode. You’re probably thinking that’s how you operate already—but really think about your life and events you’ve experienced. Think deeply.

Did you get the *most* from those experiences? Or did you spend the majority of the time worrying, checking, staying vigilant about this and that, becoming mentally exhausted? I bet it’s the latter. And that’s okay—honestly, I’m convinced that’s just the human default doing what it always does. It’s incredibly hard to “let go” and “let things happen.” We *know* we should, we *tell* ourselves it’ll be different next time—but that’s why this fear is so insidious. It creeps in under the cover of that mental whirlwind right before you begin something new.

We must gently remind ourselves not to let this happen. Calm the mind before engaging in new activities. And most importantly, trust that *if* something were to happen—you’d handle it right then and there like an absolute boss. Believe that. Build that belief during meditation. Make it your *knowing*.

#### Exploring Intuition Session

This was a really great session for multiple reasons. For one, it might be the first Gateway session I’ve done that went *exactly* as described in the manual—from the instructions to the actual experience. I’m not going to say, “Yep, I finally and totally figured out how to shut my mind up and actively observe.” That wouldn’t be entirely true. But I *do* remind myself as part of my pre-session ritual that *this* is the time to listen, and that I’ll remember everything that occurs—and analyze it afterward.

In the first half of the tape, you’re guided into advanced Focus 12 (starting right away in F12), and encouraged to ask whether any limiting beliefs or thoughts might interfere with accessing your natural intuitive state. I didn’t do this part very well the first time around—so I set a clear intention to get to the bottom of it this time. And lo and behold, I got a short, sharp, to-the-point answer:\
***Stop analyzing. Stop thinking. You’re thinking too much. You’re probably analyzing this right now. It won’t help.***

So I took the message seriously, accepted it, and let it go—back into the collective stream of consciousness from where it came.

The second half is all about focusing your intent on connecting with your natural intuitive self—where it comes from, and how to strengthen your bond with it. I set my intention accordingly… and man, it was hard—but I shut the hell up and just listened.

I started seeing short snippets of random interactions—moments with Kim, my kids, friends, work colleagues (and yes, I *do* have actual friends at work—so if you’re reading this, you’re in the friend group), strangers, etc. I was observing it all, and then it hit me:\
***My intuition is drawn from contact and interaction with others.***

It went further. The visuals shifted into a verbal message that walked me through some realizations I hadn’t considered before.

The reason my intuition works this way is because I’m an empath. I feel what others feel more deeply than most. I “read the room” naturally. I don’t need to *think* about putting myself in others’ shoes during conflict or celebration—it just happens. That sounds like a superpower—and it kind of is—but it’s also a double-edged sword.

Why is it that, in waking life, an empath can feel what others feel? Not exactly, but on a scale from 0 (nothing) to 10 (everything), I’d say I sit somewhere between 6 and 9 depending on external events, internal thoughts, mood, sleep quality, etc.

We’ve seen the re-emergence of consciousness theories that suggest consciousness is non-local. It doesn’t reside solely in your head, interacting with the world only through your senses. Instead, your brain is like a “master sensor” connected to a vast and dynamic field of consciousness—from which your individuated self operates. Naturally, some people are better at tuning into others’ states—through sensation, through body language, through how their physical form responds in this reality.

Someone like that—someone like me—can feel what others are feeling in waking life, because *all* of it originates from the same universal field of consciousness. Physical matter reality arises *from* non-physical matter reality—which is consciousness itself.

So what happens when we bypass physical reality and go straight to the source? Well… isn’t that exactly what we’re doing in this exercise?

I’m already in F12, which I’ve dubbed the *consciousness-net*. I ask it a question—and an answer comes. Somewhere *within* this net, which I am also a part of. So perhaps it’s no surprise that this deeper level of intuition arises when I ask questions while immersed in the collective consciousness—the consciousness-net, the everything, the source, the All.

#### Something to Ponder

Rich man or poor man, they are the same—just re-arrangements of the same mind. Individuated consciousness is simply a re-arrangement of total consciousness. *The All*. The Source.

**Your mind is my mind, re-arranged.**
