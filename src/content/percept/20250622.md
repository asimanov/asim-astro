### "Breathe Deeply & Relax Completely"

#### Dick Sutphen – Better Receiver Part 2

Last week I did the first tape of Dick Sutphen’s “Better Receiver” two-part hypnosis series. It was illuminating and marked my first foray into *just* hypnosis, completely unassisted by binaural beats or any other technology. This time I did the second tape, and I prepared by completely forgetting everything that happened last week. Going in blind each time is the key for me. I set my intention for the session, what I want to achieve, then I metaphorically throw it out the window or lock it in my ECB as prep before the work begins.

All I wanted to do was complete “Better Receiver” training. That was my number one goal: to strengthen the connection between me, the observer, and the visions, intuition, messages, and so on that I usually receive during these sessions. I already knew this session would involve past life regression, but I wasn’t anticipating meeting my guide. I’ve written before about meeting my guide, but all of those previous meetings were more metaphorical, involving a trail of breadcrumbs that led me to this point. After all, this whole journey is about following what’s laid out in front of me. It’s all connected in one way or another, and one day I’ll see the full picture in its gestalt.

**Without further setup, here are my field notes from *“Better Receiver Part 2”*:**

* 5-minute prep meditation in F10. Saw someone on my way to my ECB. I’ve been seeing this individual move closer and closer with each meditation involving ECB. The first time he appeared was last weekend. I remember seeing him as I walked to my ECB and thinking, “I know you.” I didn’t feel suspicious of him at all. Since then he’s been getting closer, now he’s right there. Sometimes he walks with me.
  Side note: my ECB used to be inside the cave, but over time it’s moved further and further out. Now it’s on the rocky beach, surrounded by vegetation and flowers. I make a point not to influence the setting. I always let it unfold naturally. I know this sounds strange, but once you get in the habit of doing these, you’ll understand.
* Hypnosis begins: “Breathe deeply and relax completely.”
* I won’t go into detail about how you're prompted to contact your guide, but it essentially just happens. You’re given the suggestion that it is happening.
* My guide appeared: dark-skinned, reddish tone, African or Aborigine. Tribal and cultural tattoos, rings in ears and lip (gauges), carrying a spear, necklace (bone, maybe teeth). Not tall. Salt and pepper hair, short and coarse, nearly bald. Brown or hazel eyes, long gaze. Barefoot. A hunter. Felt ancient and deeply wise.
* My guide doesn’t say much. Everything is quick, to the point, efficient. No messing around. Sounds familiar.
* When I wondered about his name, I first saw “Percy,” then the letters PECTRIOUX, which seemed like a bizarre sequence.

  * Only connection I could find: “pectoraux” is French for chest muscles, pectoralis major and minor. These control movements like pushing and pulling.
  * Maybe “chest” is just a symbol for where the heart resides, or maybe “chest muscles” is code for “heart.”
  * For the record, I don’t speak French.
* I asked him questions. He responded quickly, almost before I could finish asking. I asked if he started appearing during my meditation prep. “Yes.” I asked why. “It is time.”

  * Before this hypnosis session I did a quick ECB/REBAL and he was there. While I placed things in my ECB, he was holding something smoldering and waving it over me, something about “repairs.”
* One sentence from him: “There is still time, much to do and take your time.”

*Note about what the guide said to me:* it’s perfectly ambiguous and fits right in with this kind of exploration. Everything always “is” and “isn’t.” It’s frustrating, but I’m getting used to it.

**The following are field notes from the Past Life Regression part of the training. You’re dropped into a “past life” situation completely blind. You’re told to use your imagination to get things going, but most importantly, just go with whatever comes to you first. Don’t think. Just observe. Let go and surrender. This is what happened:**

* 15 years old.
* It’s my birthday.
* Riverbank. I’m fishing.
* Blue overalls, simple clothes, straw or canvas hat.
* Dirty blonde, medium-length hair, messy and feathered in the wind. Eyes are gray.
* Boots were just some plain, worn-out things.
* I’m alone. I chuckle, because solitude shows up a lot in my happy memories.
* The year is 1763, Virginia.

  * Historical note: this was a tense time. The British Proclamation of 1763 had just restricted westward expansion after the French and Indian War. This angered colonists, including land speculators like George Washington. It helped fuel the American Revolution.
* Fast-forward: I’m doing something good, happy, and important. I see myself raising a frame for a structure, a barn or maybe a house. Just frame after frame going up, hammering away.

#### Dick Sutphen – Astral Projection, First Session (Conditioning and Prep)

**Session field notes:**

* “Breathe deeply and relax completely.”
* No binaural beats, just hypnosis.
* Spirit of quietness enters.
* Visualize the relaxation force sweeping up the body, finishing at the head.
* Countdown from 7 to 1, sinking deeper with each number.
* Guided affirmations install or reinforce beliefs that you can project safely, easily, and remain in control. You’ll remember everything.

  * It’s all very similar to the Gateway Tapes, but condensed into one session. Sutphen says repetition strengthens this. Maybe that’s Gateway’s method: more structure, more pacing.
* The exercises felt easier than Gateway’s. Gateway uses binaural tech, but I felt more successful here right away. Maybe it’s the technique, or maybe it’s that after a year of daily meditation, surrender is second nature now.
* “Growing” out of the feet was easy to visualize.
* “Growing” out of the top of my head took more effort, but on the final attempt I clearly saw myself hovering above my body in a semi-seated position.
* Near the end, my energy-body arms were moving all around, going to my head and back down like stretching or shaking something off. I also had a clear sensation of opening my mouth and moving my tongue, it just wasn't my physical mouth and tongue.

  * I’ve experienced this before during binaural meditations. Energy arms moving to my mouth, even a sensation of putting something in and biting down. Weird, but it happens.

#### Dick Sutphen – Astral Projection, Second Session

Same cold opening: **“BREATHE DEEPLY AND RELAX COMPLETELY.”**
This session is similar to the first but with more focus on chakras. You open each one and charge the energy body. The whole sequence felt like tuning into F10, then F12. Same sensations. Same spaces.

When I first tried Sutphen’s hypnosis, the deep relaxation felt exactly like F10. The chakra work felt like F12. Different words, same terrain.

Focusing on the root chakra and using the “limitless power of imagination”—the way he says it really matters—I did feel it vibrating. That sensation grew stronger as I moved up the chakras. By the time I was ready to exit, I felt properly “buzzy” and electric.

When I say “buzzy,” I mean high-frequency, steady vibrations. Not like a massage chair or tornado. More like a hum of electricity. I felt like if I touched water, I’d electrocute everything in it.

The “growing” out of the top of your head feels exactly like F12. The only difference: Gateway encourages expanding and stretching limbs, reaching. Sutphen’s method just says grow out of your head. I connect with that. It’s the transition point. A clean handoff from physical to non-physical.

What really struck me was how real and familiar this felt. I flashed back to being 16 and in the middle of a brutal flu. I woke up mid-fever dream, sat up, and felt like I was 20 feet tall, my head grazing the ceiling, my body expanding uncontrollably. I panicked and snapped back into my body. That was an altered state of consciousness, and now I’ve recreated it on purpose.

The session ended. I didn’t quite reach a full, conscious OBE, but I was on the razor’s edge for a long stretch. I can't help but wonder... if using this same technique with a gentle binaural track over 60 to 120 minutes might be the right fuel to launch us into deeper exploration of subtle realities and altered states of consciousness.
