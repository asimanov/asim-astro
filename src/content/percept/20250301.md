### Wave 6 - Non-Physical Friends, REM Vision

**During this exercise I did my very best to remove all traces of analytical thinking and just be there, fully aware. Of course, by focusing on removing analytical thinking I… ended up doing analytical thinking. 😂**

#### Wave 6 - Non-Physical Friends 

Regardless, during the moments I managed to go with the flow, I caught a glimpse of things coming together. The first time I called my guides over and asked for assistance, I definitely felt their presence—mild, but noticeable. I worked through visualization at each step of merging energy bodies, imagining my consciousness floating above my physical form while the guides helped lift me up. The sensation was there, and so was the genuine emotion behind it.

I’ve noticed recently how much easier it is to detect and lean into positive emotions, whether they come from me or elsewhere. Negative emotions, on the other hand, seem to repel me—not just during meditation, but in everyday life as well.

Overall, the exercise was intriguing. I sensed more of their energy than I actually witnessed visually; no out-of-body experience, and I didn’t truly “meet” my guides despite asking for clarity on who they were.

There was a small exchange near the end. Out of the four presences, I felt one on my right most strongly. I did my best to focus on that energy and asked questions in a messy mix of verbal thought and NVC. Let’s call this energy “NPF” (Non-Physical Friend):

- Me: Hi there! 👋😀
- NPF: ...
- Me: Who are you? 
- NPF: ...
- Me: Are you one of my guides?
- NPF: Yes.
- Me: Are you a non-human intelligence? 
- NPF: Yes.
- Me: Cool, so who are you?
- NPF: ...
- Me: Are you benevolent? 
- NPF: Yes.
- Me: Do you love me unconditionally? 
- NPF: Yes.
- Me: How am I doing? (referring to the exercise)
- NPF: ...
- Me: 🤣

I followed the tape session with an unguided F12 practice, and it went almost exactly like the previous one—minus the little chat, of course. 👍

#### REM Vision 

Afterward, I shut everything down and tried to take a nap. I’ve been struggling with naps lately, and this time was no different. However, I started a breathing exercise and the F10 count right away.

With about 10 minutes left before I had to get up, I finally felt that deep, dreamlike state sink in. Typical: it arrives right when I’m about to run out of time.

The vision sequence was... intense. I saw quick images of a katana, then a peasant stopped on a dirt road by a samurai or swordsmith who beheaded the poor soul in one clean stroke. He examined the blade—brand new, apparently testing its sharpness—completely indifferent to what he’d just done. The tone was that this was simply the custom; some folks had more “rights” than others back then. Another man, seemingly related to the victim, rushed in, and the sword-wielder slashed him as well. A bloody mist hung in the air; the man’s belongings dropped to the dirt, and he collapsed. The samurai wiped the blade with a rag, studying it like a piece of art (a katana truly is art), displaying zero emotion for the lives he had just ended.

I have no idea why I saw that. Japanese culture wasn’t on my mind at all this year. My immediate reaction was negative—there was such palpable brutality in how quickly and casually life was taken. I understood it as a harsh norm of that era, but it was still jarring.

Is that the price of technological or artistic innovation? A near-blind focus on “killing machines” with zero regard for life? Maybe that’s the lesson behind all of this, or maybe there are multiple lessons.
