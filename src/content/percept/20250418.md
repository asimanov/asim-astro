### Odyssey  

**About every three months or so, I take a week off from my usual physical training and replace my typically very active early-morning routine with meditation sessions. Bonus: if I can align this with time off work so I have completely free mornings, days, and evenings, it becomes morning, afternoon, and evening meditation sessions for about five days. It's like a mini-meditation retreat‚Äîmaybe someday I'll make it an actual retreat and change locations, too!**

#### Day One  

###### Sensing Locale 1  

- All went well.  
- Did not click out or fall asleep.  
- I swear I felt my cheap metal shoe rack by the entry to the study.  
- It felt black, shiny, cold.  
- Definitely feeling my energy/second body expanding in directions I want it to go.  

###### Expansion Locale 1  

- Another excellent session.  
- Lifted up and back down; clearly felt the sensation of movement with my center.  

---

#### Day Two  

###### Expansion into Locale 1  

- Smooth transition into F10.  
- Phased into F12 without issue, increasingly focusing on feeling the energy body.  
- Vibrations haven‚Äôt been strong for me lately; I'm accustomed to feeling a general buzz outside my physical body.  
- Often, I also feel like I'm gently wobbling side to side.  
- Once instructed to feel lighter and float up, I recalled how effortless this is in a lucid dream and felt the same lifting sensation.  
- While floating, I impulsively turned my energy body in a circle, counterclockwise. I'd previously worked hard on this, but this time, all it took was a thought and intention, and I turned smoothly.  
- Floating back down felt natural.  
- Phasing out of focus levels is becoming more gradual, smooth, and natural.  

###### Point of Departure  

- Went smoothly overall.  
- I don‚Äôt think I had the complete experience, but it was more than I've experienced in the past.  
- This time, I clearly heard instructions that I don't fully remember‚Äîthis is good, as I didn‚Äôt click out.  
- During the free-flow part, I stalled but didn‚Äôt click out‚Äîjust kind of hovered in place.  
- I'm not experiencing a full OBE yet, but I am feeling it clearly.  
- During the turning sequence, I definitely felt the motion, with noticeably more success turning to my left (counterclockwise). Noted.  
- Upon returning to my physical body, I felt a bit nauseated in F12, but it faded by the time I fully emerged.  

---

#### Day Three  

###### Point of Departure  

- I've underestimated how much physical activity I'd still be doing during my "week off" from exercise. Now, I'm quite tired in the mornings‚Äîactually, all day.  
- Similar to the previous day, not much different except I can move easily when I want to‚Äîjust not sure where I'm going. It's mostly sensations without clear visuals.  
- Phosphene activity was different today: more active and complex. Interesting.  

###### Nonphysical Friends  

- Still physically tired and experiencing some pain, but managed well enough.  
- Once in F12, I called upon four guides as instructed and quickly felt their presence around me. As before, four shadows appeared, looming over me one-by-one, shifting positions.  
- When I asked to be lifted, the upward movement was immediate and rapid.  
- During the free-flow portion, I tried engaging them and experienced a few ‚Äúhead shocks,‚Äù but no clear communication‚ÄîI was too tired to maintain focus.  
- I did briefly see a faint face and later a small, faint, dancing figure. I think it had wings. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### Day Four  

###### Nonphysical Friends  

- The prep session went well. I recognized attachments to my physical body‚Äîthe bond between identity and the body is strong. I understand this, though the body is not *the* identity.  
- Transitions between focus levels becoming increasingly automatic and smooth.  
- I‚Äôm better at sensing vibrations now; they don't need to be overwhelming. They're always there, and it's about tuning awareness to them. I can feel energy move from bottom to top and back down. The vibrations are steady, constant like an electrical current, reminding me I'm alive.  
- The guides appeared immediately upon my call.  
- The sensation of quickly lifting and lowering was strong and distinct.  
- As usual, I attempted to engage with the guides, and typically one or two engaged briefly.  
- At one point, my entire field of view was filled by an eye. I've seen a floating eye many times before, but this one was anchored to a face. It was green. As it pulled back, I saw a face wearing reading glasses‚Äîmiddle-aged or mature, masculine, nonthreatening. Curiosity was the dominant emotion.  
- I thanked my guides and transitioned back to wakefulness, attending to some very annoying itches.  

###### Movement to Locale 2, Intro to F21  

- All prep steps went smoothly. Spent more time in F12 going deeper while waiting.  
- Previously, this session had been empty darkness. This time, whenever I even slightly considered calling on a guide, something showed up immediately. At this point, I don't know their names, but they consistently respond, even to subtle thoughts.  
- The persistent, often pulsating green and gold light is now certainly a visual representation of a guide. Too many occurrences align.  
- Moving from F12 to F21, encouraged to pay attention to different focus levels, I got more from this attempt than before.  
- Possibly in F18 (heart), I had a brief vision, but it's not clear now.  
- Clicked out a couple of times, including during free-flow time. Not upset; this usually signifies something positive.  
- Visual clarity still missing‚Äîmostly dark, blurry sensations. Perhaps this needs adjustment or upgrading.

#### Day Five  

###### Movement to Locale 2, Intro to F21  

- Prep session was fine, but harder to concentrate this morning due to minor distractions.  
- Last night, I requested assistance or upgrades from my higher self to better navigate F21.  
- Today's session was more active, energy-rich, and felt improved compared to yesterday.  
- Early on, I moved through a portal-shaped light into dark space filled with stars. Felt genuine depth and space.  
- Realized that previous exercises with moving the energy body significantly aided navigation in F21.  
- Movement in this space was intuitive, though I felt like a newborn puppy‚Äîstill figuring things out but feeling welcomed.  
- Looking forward to further exploration and trusting intuition‚Äîthis feels like the right direction.  

###### Free Flow Journey in F21  

- Sometimes preparation is perfect, but things still go awry‚ÄîI twitched myself out of focus repeatedly today.  
- Suspected I was too tired beforehand, which probably contributed.  
- Multiple twitch disruptions forced me to repeatedly reset my attempts. Eventually, I mentally encased my feet in concrete and put a straitjacket on my body, which stabilized me.  
- Managed to move through light into F21, though experienced less activity than this morning.  
- Clicked out multiple times, especially when calling on guides‚Äîusually a good sign. Not upset, just needed rest instead. Better luck next time!

#### In Conclusion  

While I took the entire week off routine exercise, I unexpectedly engaged in substantial physical activity during a major Spring Cleaning spree with Kim. Reorganizing my study, moving concrete blocks, and installing horse mats proved exhausting. Ultimately, circumstances conspired somewhat against the ideal state for my "mini-meditation retreat," serving as a valuable lesson for future planning. Nevertheless, the overall experience remained rewarding, insightful, and beneficial!
