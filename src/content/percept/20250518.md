### Checkpoint

**I’ve been knocking on the door of F21 for a while now. While I’ve seen results here and there, I still don’t feel like I’m quite experiencing what I should be. Did you catch the limiting belief? I have to be honest. I’ve learned about limiting beliefs, and I understand the power of imagination to shape reality. But life happens. We get tired. We forget. We’re not perfect machines (that’s a feature), so it’s necessary to reinforce and remember every now and then.**

#### Wave VII – Voyager – Explore Total Self

I set my intention and moved through the prep process without issue. This series uses a quicker prep than the earlier ones, which caught me off guard at first. I adjusted easily and was off to the races. The process of reaching F21 felt different too. I think I’ve learned at least three distinct methods by now. This one is particularly nice because it includes a kind of checkpoint system along the way: F10, F12, F15, F21.

You’re encouraged to spend a little time at each focus level before moving on, which feels like stepping your awareness through subtle transitions. It reminds me of something I’ve mentioned before. Moving between focus levels feels like tuning a radio. I pause at each “station” and let the signal come in clearly before continuing.

After arriving at F21, I was met with the usual sense of non-activity, although I know it’s incredibly active. I’m getting more used to seeing shadows pass by me, with some seeming to pause and observe before moving on. There’s a faint white glow at the back of my eyes or across my field of view, like being gently shadowboxed, if that makes sense. I’ve also come to accept that my experiences tend to be rich in feeling and sensation, not so much visual. This time, though, I noticed some audible phenomena that piqued my curiosity. Since this was a guided session, I stayed on task.

I was prompted to call on my “total self,” the “inner helper,” and establish contact. Almost immediately, I saw my familiar gold and green glowing, pulsing orb. Then I began asking questions as instructed. As you might imagine, my inner helper had some thoughts about the exercise.

* **Q: What is the relationship between the two of us?**

  > I am you, you are me. You know this.

* **Q: How did you come into being?**

  > I always was.

* **Q: How many physical lifetimes have you lived?**
  *(No answer)*

* **Q: How many physical lifetimes have *I* lived?**

  > Six. Not important. You've been here before. This time you're early.

Weird answer. Six doesn’t sound like a lot. I’ve gotten similarly low numbers before, so I’m letting this one go. Honestly, this topic doesn’t interest me much.

* **Q: What are the three most important lifetimes I’ve lived?**

  > Warrior. Lots of war. You were good at it. Violence.

*Note: I come from a very strong military family. I’m the first man in my family not to pursue a military career. My entire childhood I was told the military wasn’t my path and not to even consider it. Even in a different country, several people and events blocked me from joining the Navy or Air Force, though I had every intention of doing so. I also developed a reputation in school for fighting early and often, and enjoying it. I studied Kendo at age 11. Combat and war games were always high on my list. In my mid-20s, I came to abhor war and human suffering.*

* **Q: What is the purpose of living a physical human life here in Earth, time, and space?**

  > To learn and grow. Lower entropy. You already know this.

* **Q: What is my purpose in this physical life instance?**

  > **Illuminate, help, heal, learn, and grow.**

That phrase was repeated several times. I’ve been told to “illuminate” before, and it feels like it’s time to stop asking this question.

* **Q: How can I best achieve this goal?**

  > You already are. You know how.

Again, I got the strong sense that I should stop asking and move forward.

At the end, I thanked my inner helper and said I’d reach out again soon. The reply came instantly:
**"We're in constant contact. No need for special rituals. We literally talk often. You. Know. This."**

They’re right. I do know that. Honestly, I felt a little silly continuing the session. It didn’t feel necessary. Still, I gained something valuable... a more evolved sense of Focus 21.

It was important for me to experience this, because unlike previous attempts, I focused specifically on shifting my awareness away from my physical body, completely and fully. That’s a difficult thing to achieve, and your ego will fool you into thinking you’ve done it when you haven’t.

That’s just how the human body works, and there’s a good reason for it. The ego is doing its job, and it’s very good at it. So much so, it can trick you into believing something has happened when it hasn’t.

Still, I continue putting most of my attention on my energy body during entry into F12. Doing this repeatedly has helped me genuinely exit awareness of the physical. When I traverse the focus levels back, I make sure to feel each one with full awareness before stepping through. I believe this strengthens and reinforces my connection to each state, creating a kind of internal “focus map.” Or, in my favorite metaphor, it strengthens the signal signature for each station so tuning gets faster and more precise over time. 📻
