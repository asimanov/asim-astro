When I attended the university I developed a habit of doodling while listening to lectures (like most of us probably did). This habit never really went away, in fact it got significantly stronger with time. For instance, if I'm in a meeting I HAVE to doodle on my notes... Why do I have to? Believe it or not, but this is how I can concentrate on the actual meeting itself. I'm sure that it appears rude, but I must retain the information of the meeting so I have to draw something, anything. Back at the uni I took a 3D animation course that was incredibly hard but equally rewarding. So it was there that I drew Virgil the Space Bear. If you must know, the lecture that I drew the guy in was on texture and lighting in Maya (super awesome, the rest of Maya was super hard).
