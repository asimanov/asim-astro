A good friend of mind asked if I could come up with an identity for his personal project right before the start of 2022. The concept was pretty straightforward and the overall process took a little over a week to complete from concept to finalized identity system.

As with all identity projects and all creative projects in general, it started with ink on paper. Since it's been a little while I've misplaced said ink on paper so you're just going to have to trust me.

Here is Otterdotit complete with my typical **brand identity standard** presentation.
