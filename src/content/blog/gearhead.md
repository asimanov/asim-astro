10 weeks is a mighty long time for anything... In 10 weeks I produced 10 unique illustrations for you fine people to adorn your work-space with, and now I must rest... For, at least, a week. "Gear Head" is my tribute to my family, Simanov, as it is ground work for the crest of my kin. With this entry I leave you for 14 days and let someone much more capable to watch over in my place this coming seven days for I must rest, for now... Fellow Homo Sapiens, I must rest.
