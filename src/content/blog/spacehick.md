Last week's abduction illustration got me thinking about the aliens that seem to (purely from the accounts of people who claim to have been "abducted") come whenever they please (apparently at night) and shove things up the orifices (I'm going to assume for science). What kind of sick beings are these aliens? Travel millions of light years only to scare the shit out of everyone and torture them like someone from "The Devil's Rejects" ... Wait a minute...
