<strong>Having a difficult time at work? Need some inspiration to turn your otherwise and seemingly lack luster day into a Don Draper moment?</strong> Well, we can't promise a turn-of-a-dime inspiration moment that saves your sinking company while you sit and sip on your scotch on the rocks... Although, we can promise that you will think twice about going into that meeting without a pad and pen in hand and a bone to pick with your stagnant career. It's your day, and damn right it's your desktop wallpaper... You've earned it, now take it.
