I had so much fun making the original "Timeboxed" illustration for the [Timeboxed post](/blog/timeboxed "Timeboxed") that I went back and made a few edits. I guess this is, in a way, my "thank you" to the Scrum/Agile community. 

Full res is 2560x1440, feel free to slap it on your desktop (or any desktop) and call it job done. üëè
