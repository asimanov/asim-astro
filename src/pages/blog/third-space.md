<strong>"Third Space"</strong> is the first Pixelnaut Press original to feature our brand in an "up front and personal" manner. We understand that doing this kind of work in different styles is very popular and expected, but this was a long-time-coming. We didn't want to introduce our icon on EVERY piece of original content as much as possible for obvious reasons (lets face it, being annoying isn't very tactful). So here you have it, the first blatant and bold Pixelnaut Press giveaway.

**Note: This illustration was originally created for *Pixelnaut Press publication* which is no longer in production.**
