It has been well over a year since I put this piece together. Sometime before the chaos of 2020 began, around March in the States, I was feeling a little bit burnt out and decided to make a quick illustration as a bit of a creative outlet. I'm not a superstitious person but looking back at the timing of this doodle and the events of 2020 I decided to call it **"Premonition 2020"**. I originally intended for this piece to be the first panel of a triptych, maybe it will be a "three year" triptych with panels for 2020, 2021, and 2022.
