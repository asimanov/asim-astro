### Trip - Wave 4, Freeflow F12 - Unguided F12

**Decided it was a good day to munch on 1.6 g of Golden Teacher and see where my meditations take me. It wasn't what I expected but what I needed right in this moment in my journey.**

#### Set & Setting

I had a light-ish lunch with some chocolate covered roasted espresso beans. I then bitterly chewed on 1.6 g of GT and washed it down with water. Kim and I watched about half of a documentary and decided that it was time to relax for a bit. I went off to meditate by myself in my office like I normally do. Honestly outside of GT this was an incredibly typical Saturday. 

#### Wave 4, Freeflow F12

#### Unguided F12

#### An attempt to nap

You can't, it's not possible with GT. 

#### Closing out the evening

#### F15 & Lights Out

This was the nudge I needed to move on in my practice, I was stuck.
